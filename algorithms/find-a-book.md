# Find a book

## Question

Imagine you are looking for a book in a library with a Dewey Decimal index...

How would you go about it?

Can you express this process as a searching algorithm?

### Answer

Assuming I know how to interpret the dewey decimal system, in order to find a book using the index I would examine the number, narrow my search based on the information I could gather, until I located the book.

As a search algorithm, this process would work as follows...

1. Examine a digit of the decimal index consecutively
2. Use the digit to narrow my search space
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 until all characters have been examined
